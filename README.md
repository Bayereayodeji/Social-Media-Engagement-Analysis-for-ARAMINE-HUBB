# Social-Media-Engagement-Analysis-for-ARAMINE-HUBB
an in-depth Social Media Engagement Analysis for ARAMINE HUB

As I continue to advance my data analytics journey with Vephla University (Data School), I recently conducted an in-depth Social Media Engagement Analysis for ARAMINE HUB. The analysis focused on a 1-month online engagement dataset sourced from Kaggle.com. My objective was to uncover critical insights into engagement patterns and behaviors, providing actionable recommendations to enhance future performance.

Key Insights:
•	Longest period online: 79 hours without a break.
•	Top Engaging Platform by Posts: Facebook led with 25% of total posts.
•	Top Engaging Platform by Likes: Instagram took the lead with 30% of all likes.
•	Most Active Client by Gender: Males dominated with 592 comments.
•	Dominant Emotion: "Neutral" was the prevailing emotion, with a 28% share.

Areas of Weakness:
1.	Underperforming Platforms: Both WhatsApp (4%) and Telegram (11%) fell behind in engagement.
2.	Dominant Emotion: The prevalence of a "Neutral" emotion suggests gaps in communication, potentially reducing user engagement quality.

Recommendations:
•	Optimizing WhatsApp & Telegram Engagement: As rapidly growing platforms with broad reach, WhatsApp and Telegram present valuable opportunities for deeper engagement. Investing in staff development programs to enhance platform usage could significantly improve future performance.
•	Improving Emotional Engagement: With "Neutral" being the most recorded emotion, it's vital to reevaluate communication strategies. A clearer and more direct information flow will help foster a more positive emotional response from clients, aiming for higher satisfaction and engagement.
